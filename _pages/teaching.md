## Philosophy on teaching

Arianna believes teaching to be **equally important** to scholarly research. Developing learning materials, mentoring students, and participating in outreach is **critical to improving access to education in diverse populations**. Arianna's experiences with teaching have both informed and redirected her research pursuits. Arianna has teaching interests in data science, computational science, physiology, and ecology and environmental science, in particular aquatic ecology.

Computational science suffers from below-average diversity because of a lack of effective teaching and outreach (Lang et al. 2016). Arianna is committed to creating inclusive learning experiences that illustrate the power of computing approaches across disciplines.

### Summer 2023 Woods Hole Science Stroll

Approximately **1,800 visitors** were counted strolling on the dock at WHOI this year for the annual Woods Hole Science Stroll event, the first since before the pandemic! We were so glad to be able to represent the efforts of the Broader Impacts Group (BIG) at this year's event.

### Fall 2022 outreach experiences

Fall 2022 outreach experiences included representing WHOI at Junior Achievement's [career fair](https://twitter.com/WHOI/status/1606032077954113542), at Keith Middle School's fall [Science Nights of Wonder](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/woods-hole-oceanographic-institution_inspiration-whoi-mitabrwhoi-activity-7011797797599367168-L6Eb?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), and in K-12 classrooms. Thanks to so many awesome people for putting these opportunities together for us to share what we do and why we love aquatic ecology and several other ocean disciplines!

### Course design: phytoplankton physiology & ecology

Arianna designed a course in Fall 2021 on Phytoplankton Physiology & Ecology. Some of the materials for the seminar are maintained [here](https://2021-phyto-phys.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html). Arianna co-taught the course in Fall 2021 (with her advisor Mick Follows).

### Teaching Assistant for MIT 7.470: Biological Oceanography

Arianna was the TA for the Spring 2022 offering of biological oceanography, which is the first-year required course for the MIT-WHOI Joint Program in Biological Oceanography. As part of this role, she prepared recitation presentations and exam reviews, and helped students learn field skills on a one-day oceanographic day trip on the R/V Tioga.

### Falmouth Summer Academy

In Summer 2021, Arianna taught a course about the intersection between math and environmental science to a group of 11 elementary and middle school-age children. Arianna had a fantastic time learning more about science communication, and how to market math to a group of naturalists...and to entice mathematicians to care about important word problems!

### Marine Biological Laboratory Physiology Course Bioinformatics Bootcamp

Arianna assisted the class as a TA, including developing and teaching course materials on [transcriptomics](https://github.com/MBL-Physiology-Bioinformatics/2021-Bioinformatics-Tutorial-Materials/tree/master/transcriptomics).


### Summer 2021 HSSP: Modeling Demographic Dynamics in Human Populations

Arianna co-taught a 3-week course on Demographic Modeling (including human and bacterial populations) in Summer 2021, many of the students being of high-school age.

### Summer 2021 Educational Studies Program: Ocean Phytoplankton and Coccolithophores

In August 2021, Arianna gave a lecture about ocean phytoplankton and biogeochemistry to a classroom of 75+ high school students...on a Saturday!

### Summer 2020 HSSP: Bayesian Statistics & Biological Applications

In Summer 2020, Arianna co-taught a 6-week course on Bayesian statistics to a group of nearly 40 students, mainly of high school age. This class included Bayesian statistics basics and specific applications to biology. Part of this was a use case for coronavirus research, because this course overlapped with the early- to mid-stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. One specific example was how likely it was that a person had been infected with COVID-19, given that they had tested positive for antibodies.

We also talked about mark-recapture and other ecological applications of Bayesian analysis. See below for the slides from our second session of the course!
