Arianna's research clusters around three main scientific questions:

1. How does intraspecific diversity structure marine phytoplankton communities and provide evidence for their future resilience to environmental change? 
    - Past projects that support this emphasis area: [Krinos et al. 2025 _Ecology Letters_](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/ele.70055), laboratory experiments with combined temperature and nutrient effects on strains
    - Current projects that support this emphasis area: forthcoming work to characterize coccolithophore intraspecific diversity
2. How do phytoplankton compete for resources in coastal ecosystems over temporal scales, and how does this result in changes in species succession?
    - Past projects that support this emphasis area: Krinos et al. 2026 submitting to _Global Change Biology_, [Lake Mendota work](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40168-024-01831-y), past collaborative works
    - Current projects that support this emphasis area: Collaborative work with the Brisbin lab at USF, [Collaborative work at the Salton Sea in California](https://saltonseascience.org/), [Collaborative work with Bridge-to-PhD fellow Emily Hu](https://mara-freilich.github.io/people)
3. What is the relationship between taxonomic diversity and functional redundancy in marine microbes (or, eukaryotes)?
    - Past projects that support this emphasis area: [EUKulele (Krinos et al. 2021)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02817), [eukrhythmic (Krinos et al. 2023)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12859-022-05121-y), tax-aliquots/cryptic taxonomic diversity [(Krinos et al. 2024)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-52212-w) 
    - Current projects that support this emphasis area: using metatranscriptomic data to tune models with meaningful taxonomic subgroupings (Krinos et al. 2026 in prep), [Multiscale modeling framework with C-CoMP](https://ccomp-stc.org/research/network-sensitivity-and-feedbacks-on-climate/), 2025 C-CoMP cruises data analysis
