My research projects to identify traits relevant to models and environmental change prediction fall into one or more of three major categories:

1. **Protistan diversity and taxonomy-function relationships**
2. **Phytoplankton succession & community dynamics**
3. **Phytoplankton biogeography**

Using one or more of these tools:

1. **Experimental culturing**
2. **Models (ecosystem & physiological)**
3. **-Omics (nucleic acid; population or community)**
