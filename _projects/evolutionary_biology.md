Marine microbial eukaryotes have complex genomes that are difficult to reconstruct from environmental data, and individual cells can be challenging to culture in the laboratory. Using -omics approaches, we can now study the inter- and intraspecific diversity in biogeochemically-relevant strains of marine protists. My current projects on this topic include:

1. Extracting genes from novel lineages from meta-omic data using clustering approaches
2. Studying strain specificity and pangenomic variability in cosmopolitan phytoplankton taxa (_Gephyrocapsa huxleyi_)
3. Improving a custom annotation tool for microbial eukaryotes, `EUKulele`
