The vast molecular diversity of phytoplankton and other protists can be tied to large-scale processes and nutrient biogeochemistry via physiology. Physiology experiments track the rate of population growth, nutrient use, or metabolite production by isolates or communities. I design physiology experiments to link genetic diversity, for example strain differentiation in the cosmopolitan coccolithophore _Gephyrocapsa huxleyi_, to traits that models can be parameterized with, for example thermal niche width or habitat.
